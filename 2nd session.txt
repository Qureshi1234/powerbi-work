# Powerbi data loading activities:

		# data  - Global orders data -- downloading this dataset: static 
				# new data: new file:....

	# fetching data directly from some servers or cloud locations....
			# 

		# # objective: 
				# perform a very simplified analysis of
					# Profit and Sales			
							# excel: 
									# Pivot table - aggregate table of some specific col
									# aggregate values: mean, min, max, count, % inform


			# automation of some process:
					# fetching dataset from some online/cloud env:
							# keep getting updated....
									# new orders, sale, customer.....

					# automated process to perform a very simplified data analysis on sale and profit
			# pivot table:
					# updated data analysis: 5 min: total profit, total sales....

					# power bi: 
								# aggregate data analysis: 


# sequence of steps:
		# fetching dataset:
		step 2: changed row1 into header
		step 3: convert date column into date type
		step 4: error appreared.... remove error....

		# counted and saved in power bi  applied speps.

		

# ICICIBANK Stock : 1 year information in power bi:
		# perform all the step:
			# 

# information on a daily basis: 
		# show last 5 days stock price movement in bars


# went through: 

	# chart creation activities:
			# fetch data from web portal: -- data loading in powerbi
			# fetch data from your computer -- global excel sheet

	# learned 
			# how to perform some basic data cleaning:
				# how to make first row as header -- data transform options
				# how to add data cleaning steps in applied step tab
				# how to change column data types...
			
			# data visualization activities:
				# how to create a basic table in power bi visual
				# how to create a line chart with stock data
				# how to create a bar chart with stock data
				# how to add some basic parameters in line chart and bar chart
				# how to create a map chart

			# data filtering activities:
				# how to perform a basic filter on date column 
				# how to perform filtering on map chart

# on a daily basis: we will be building charts like this:
		# keep performing:
			# data pre processing/cleaning
			# data filtering activities
			# data visualizations

# at the end of 6th session:
			# repeating all these activities on a daily basis:
					

# one topic at one time: 
			# next: 5-6times:::
					
# i will keep increasing level of difficulties:::
